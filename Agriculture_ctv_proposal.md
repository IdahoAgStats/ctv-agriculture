#### Scope

Agriculture science encompasses a broad breadth of disciplines. Many many package in base R and contributed packages are relevant to agricultural researchers. For that reason, this is not exhaustive list of all packages useful to agriculture researchers. It is intended to cover major packages that in most cases, have been developed specifically to support agricultural research and analytical needs. 

Our core areas encompass packages for:

  * Accessing Federal agricultural databases and data sets relevant to agricultural scientists   
  * Soil science   
  * Tools for agronomic field trials   
    * experimental design   
    * Genotype-by-environment interactions   
    * general analysis of planned field experiments (not ecological studies)   
  * breeding and genetics   
    * linkage and QTL mapping   
    * GWAS (genome-wide association studies)   
    * genetic prediction  
  * Entomology    
  * Plant Pathology   
  * Weed Science (for weed science-related topics not captured by environmetrics)   
  * Crop Modelling   
  * Animal Science   
  * Food Science   
  * Rural Sociology   
  * Agricultural Economics   


#### Packages

We have already drafted an agricultural task view [here](https://github.com/IdahoAgStats/ctv-agriculture/blob/main/agricultural_CTV.md) in a [git repo](https://github.com/IdahoAgStats/ctv-agriculture) (although no CTV file has been prepared). The majority of these packages are on CRAN, but a few can only be found on GitHub and other alternative repositories.

#### Overlap

In several cases, this proposed task view references other existing task views (e.g. spatial, econometrics) when those task views were the best alternative to repeating information. There is a small amount of overlap between the agricultural databases packages in this proposed CRAN task view and [Official Statistics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/OfficialStatistics.html) (e.g. "cdlTools", "FAOSTAT"). 

In general, there does not appear to be substantial overlap with existing CRAN task views.
