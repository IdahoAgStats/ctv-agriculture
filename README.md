#### Currently Under Construction

*(this is yet a task view)*

**New contributors welcomed!**

This is intended to be a curated collection of R packages and other R resources that serve agricultural research. The Task View highlights packages that provide features for the following categories:

* General Agriculture
* Soil Science
* Agronomic Trials
* Breeding and Genetics
* Entomology
* Plant Pathology
* Weed Science
* Animal Science
* Food Science
* Rural Sociology
* Agricultural Economics

Suggestions are welcome! If you think there should be another category or if you know of a package that fits into one of these categories, but is missing from the Task View, please open an [Issue][new-issue] to discuss. Also, see the **Contributing** link below for more details. 

[new-issue]: https://github.com/jpiaskowski/ctv-agriculture/issues/new?template=package_suggestion.md

Eventually, this repository will contain a `ctv` file for the **Agriculture CRAN Task View**.
The `ctv` file in this repository will manually sync with the official copy in the [CTV SVN repository][ctv-svn] on [R-Forge][].
