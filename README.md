This is intended to be a curated collection of R packages and other R resources that serve agricultural research. The Task View highlights packages that provide features for the following categories:

* General Packages   
  * Agricultural & landuse databases   
  * Agricultural data sets  
  * General analytical packages  
* Discipline-Specific Packages  
  * Agrometeorology  
  * Agronomic trials  
      * Experimental design   
      * High throughput phenotyping (HTP)   
      * Trial analysis
  * Animal science  
  * Breeding & quantitative genetics  
    * Linkage mapping & QTL analysis   
    * GWAS  
    * Genomic prediction   
  * Crop growth models & crop modelling  
  * Entomology  
  * Food science  
  * Genotype-by-environment interactions  
  * Plant pathology  
  * Rural sociology  
  * Soil science  
  * Weed science  

Suggestions are welcome! If you think there should be another category or if you know of a package that fits into one of these categories, but is missing from the Task View, please open an [Issue][new-issue] to discuss. Also, see the **[contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)** instructions for more details.
