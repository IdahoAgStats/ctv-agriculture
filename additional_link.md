### Tutorials
* Website: [R for Agricultural Statistics]()
* The Github repository [agroBioData](https://github.com/OnofriAndreaPG/agroBioData) houses a collection of data sets supporting agriculture and applied biology (note that this is a collection of CSV files and a `.rda` file, not a package)


### Relevant R-Forge Projects (do we really need this??)

-   The R-forge subversion repository ['cropcc'](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/?root=cropcc) hosts several R packages with climate change/cropping data set.  

* [Global Soil Information Facilities](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/gsif): an initiative of the [World Soil Information Institute and Africa Soil Information Service](africasoils.net) (ISRIC) team.  
* [Soil Spectroscopy and Chemometrics](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/soilspec/): methods for soil spectroscopy and chemometrics involving spectral data conversion, calibration and prediction methods.  
* [Digital Soil Informatic Tools](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/ithir/): quantitative and numerical analysis of soils and phenomena and other information related to soils, with a focus on pedometrics.  
* [Reclim](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/reclim/): a collection of weather reduction functions of kinetics for the introductory carbon balance model (ICBM), a compartmental soil organic carbon model.    
* [inspectr](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/inspectr/): handling and analysis of Vis-NIR spectra, with a focus on soil science applications.  
* [Crop & Disease Modelling](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/cropsim/):  dynamic & mechanistic simulation of crop growth and development, and of plant diseases. 
* [biocro](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/biocro/): functions and data for plant and crop modeling. Simulates C4 photosynthesis, biomass production and estimates parameters for plant physiological models using optimization techniques and Markov chains.
* [Crop Climate Change Course](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/cropcc/): materials for the course "Analyzing the impact of climate change on crops and varieties"
