# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the [CRAN Task View on Agriculture][ctv-ag]!

## Step 0: Open an Issue

Before you make any edits, please [open a new Issue][new-issue] to first discuss your proposed changes.
If you only want to fix a typo, please skip this for now. We are not in the stage to fix those. At this time, whole sections need to be filled out. 

[new-issue]: https://github.com/jpiaskowski/ctv-agriculture/issues/new?template=package_suggestion.md

## Step 1: Edit 'task_view_ideas.md'

Each section should contain a brief synopsis of major packages to address the topic. Not every single package needs to be mentioned. This is intended to be a curated guide, not an unabridged dictionary of every last package relevant to agricultural research. In many cases, it will make sense to send people to other CRAN task views (e.g. "TimeSeries" for ag economics, "Spatial" for soils).

If you are comfortable with Git and GitHub, you can fork this repository, clone it, and commit your changes.
If not, don't worry: [click this link to directly edit the file on GitHub](https://github.com/jpiaskowski/ctv-agriculture/edit/master/ReproducibleResearch.ctv).
When you're done making your edits, add a message at the bottom to describe the changes you made, and then click "Commit changes".

Please, write up your section(s), but refrain from editing other sections at this time (just to make merging easier at this time).

Eventually, the source file to edit will be `agriculture.ctv`, but we are not there, yet. 

## Step 2: Add your name to 'contributors' list 

In the "README.md" file. Please included your github main page web address if you want your github profile to be hyperlinked. 

## Step 3: Submit your Pull Request

[Click here to create a new Pull Request][new-pr].
In the body of the Pull Request, please reference the Issue in which we discussed your proposed change (not applicable for typo fixes).
As a hypothetical example, if we had discussed the change in Issue `1`, then you could reference this with `#1`.
