## CRAN Task View: Agricultural Analysis

Agriculture encompasses a broad breadth of disciplines. Nearly every package in base R and contributed packages on CRAN are useful to agricultural researchers. 

If you think that some package is missing from the list, please let us know.

**General**

  - *Accessing Data* : 
    Data from the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistical Service 'Quick Stats' web API can be accessed through [rnassqs](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnassqs). 
 

**Soil Science**

  - *Pedology* :
    [aqp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=aqp) provides a lot of really useful functionality and other placeholder text. 
  - *Spatial Statistics* : 
    You can (and should) refer to the ["Spatial"](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Spatial) and   ["Spatio-Temporal"](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=SpatioTemporal) CRAN task views. 
    
    
**Agronomic Trials**

  - *Experimental Design* : 
  - *Analysis* : 
  
  
**Plant Breeding and Genetics**
  - *Genomic Selection*
  
  
**Entomology** 


**Animal Science**


**Food Science**


**Rural Sociology**


**Agricultural Economics**
  - I don't know if we need all these categories. It might be that the 'Econometrics' CRAN task view is enough.
