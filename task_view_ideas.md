**General**

  - *Accessing Data* : 
  Data from the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistical Service 'Quick Stats' web API can be accessed with [rnassqs][]. The USDA's Cropland data layer API can be accessed with [CropScapeR][]. 
  - *Data sets*: 
  [Agridat][] consists of a very large collection of agricultural data sets and example analyses. 
 

**Soil Science**

  - *Pedology* :
    [aqp][] provides a lot of really useful functionality and other placeholder text. 
  - *Spatial Statistics* : 
    You can (and should) refer to the ["Spatial"](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Spatial) and   ["Spatio-Temporal"](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=SpatioTemporal) CRAN task views. 
    
    
**Agronomic Trials**

  - *Experimental Design* : The package [agricolae][] provides extensive resources for the planning and analysis of planned field experiments, . The CRAN task for [ExperimentalDesign](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Econometrics.html) provide additional information on experimental design for a wide variety of research problems. [desplot][desplot] is for plotting maps of agricultural trials laid out in grids. 
  - *Analysis* : 
  The package [gge][] is useful for producing GGE biplots. 
  
**Plant Breeding and Genetics**
  - *QTL analysis* 
  - *Genomic Selection*
  
**Entomology** 


**Animal Science**


**Food Science**


**Rural Sociology**


**Agricultural Economics**

  - The task views for [Econometrics](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Econometrics.html), [Finance](), and [TimeSeries]() provide information on packages and tools relevant to agriculture economics.
